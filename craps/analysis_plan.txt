--------------------------
Gemerate baseline data set for pass/come don't pass/don't come betting.

For each shooter, bet 1 unit on come (don't come) every roll.
After shooter 7s-out, calculate total shooter's payout.
Aggregate data across ** many ** shooters.

Summarize data:
For each roll of length n, calculate:
	payout					(mean, median, mode, and std dev)
	Number of points made	 		(mean, median, mode, and std dev)
	Number of points riding at 7-out	(mean, median, mode, and std dev)
Plot number of rolls vs:
	mean payout with std dev error bars
