--------
Roll: One throw of the dice.

Sequence: A series of rolls ending with a 7. The length of a sequence
can be as short as one roll.

Trial(n): A collection of sequences totaling at least n rolls. A trial
is complete on the first 7 rolled after n-1 rolls.


Roll Analysis
-------------
Analysis of dice and roll behavior, independent of any wagering.
1. Total rolls per Sequence
	Histogram of sequence length vs number of occurrences
2. Points made per Sequence
	Histogram of points made vs number of occurrences
3. Points covered per Sequence
	Histogram of points covered vs number of occurrences
4. Total number of points made
	3x Histogram of points made vs Sequence length (mean, median, mode)
5. Total number of points covered
	3x Histogram of points covered vs Sequence length (mean, median, mode)
6. Points covered vs points made
	Mean number of points covered per point made
	Mean number of points made per point covered

come_dont_come_baseline.py
--------------------------
Gemerate baseline data set for pass/come don't pass/don't come betting.

Bet 1 unit on come (don't come) every roll.
After Sequence 7s-out, calculate total Sequence payout.
Aggregate data across ** many ** Sequences.

Summarize data:
For each Sequence of length n, calculate:
	payout					(mean, median, mode, and std dev)
	Number of points made	 		(mean, median, mode, and std dev)
	Number of points riding at 7-out	(mean, median, mode, and std dev)
Plot number of rolls vs:
	mean payout with std dev error bars
